# Road Fatalities: An Exploratory Analysis of Road Accidents and Fatalities in the USA in the year 2020.

Road accidents and fatalities are unfortunately a common occurance in almost all parts of the world. For this project, we hoped to find insights with regards to different factors and variables affecting road accidents and fatalities.

# Data Source

We chose to source our data from The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This is an agency of the U.S. federal government, so we trusted that our data would be reliable and accurate. The NHTSA road fatality records are available to source both though an API and also through CSV files for each year.
API: https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI
CSV Archives: https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloadsp=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/2021/National/
We were unable to make API requests without providing additional filters which would have reduced the size of the dataset - this is explored later in the analysis. For this reason we decided to utilise the CSV file instead.
